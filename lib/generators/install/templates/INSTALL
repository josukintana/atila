	And now, what?

	After install, you just have to...

		- ...add to your aplication.rb the next lines:

		  	config.autoload_paths += %W(#{config.root}/lib)
			config.autoload_paths += Dir['#{config.root}/lib/**/']

		- ...include the installed modules in your User model:

			include ProfilesManagement
			include GroupsManagement
		  	include FriendsManagement
		  	include FollowmentsManagement
		  	include UsersWallManagement

		- ...run the migrations.

		- ...enjoy!
